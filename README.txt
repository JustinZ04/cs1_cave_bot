CS Cave Bot

The CS Cave Bot provides UCF students enrolled in Dr. Szumlanski's Computer Science I and Computer Science II classes a way to quickly view information about which Teaching Assistants are currently holding office hours at the time the students request information from the bot on Discord. 
The commands for the bot are: !help - To display how to use the bot.
                              !cave1 - To display the office hours of CS1 TAs.
                              !cave2 - To display the office hours of CS2 TAs.
							  
Office hour information is stored in a spreadsheet, which is downloaded periodically in case there are updates to office hour times. Logs are kept and we are alerted if the download fails. Logs are also kept everytime a command is typed to give us some data on how often the bot is used.
